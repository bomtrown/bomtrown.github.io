Using this as a requirements list for now:

## Purpose of the website:
    - I want a place where anyone can explore what I am passionate about on an actions speak louder than words basis.
    - It will feature results of projects within things I am passionate about.
    - Finally it will need an impressive front end as front end is one of those passions.

## Passions I want to feature:
    - Mathematics and coding skills.
    - Music
    - Front end/design/3d Modeling

Ideally I'd want the site to display these skills in a way that seamlessly blends them together.

A way I could achieve this is by writing a script, a single storyline at first but possibly able to split off in future versions.

## Storyline
