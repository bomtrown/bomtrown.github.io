Using this as a requirements list for now:

## Purpose of the website:
- I want a place where anyone can explore what I am passionate about on an actions speak louder than words basis.
- It will feature results of projects within things I am passionate about.
- Finally it will need an impressive front end as front end is one of those passions.

## Passions I want to feature:
- Mathematics and coding skills.
- Music
- Front end/design/3d Modeling

Ideally I'd want the site to display these skills in a way that seamlessly blends them together.

A way I could achieve this is by writing a script, a single storyline at first but possibly able to split off in future versions.

## Storyline

User opens up on the introduction page
    features my name and a subheading

'Mathematics has never been so stylish'

Demo section - really show off everything in one here - cutouts of projects, sounds, animations. Try to keep it tasteful and avoid overwhelming the user.

Projects section
- The Cryxis Project
- Car Model/Ad
- Showoff marblerun

## Design themes
To convey myself effectively through the design language I want it to encorperate traits that relate to who I am and what I like.
### Who I am:
- In progress: I'm still finding my way around what I enjoy in life so I want the site to have a purposefully 'in progress' look. This should still look purposefull and well excecuted though.
- Creative, youthful, but increasingly tasteful, colours should pop where they benefit but not overpower, eyes should be guided, not dragged.
- A bit of a showoff, effects used should not be immediately obvious how they were achieved.

### What I like:
- Cars/strong brands
- Science/mathematics - displays of mathematical 'beauty' should be plentiful
- My favourite aesthetics, 'lights', 'train', 'bright'
